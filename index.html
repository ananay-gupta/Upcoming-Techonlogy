      Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand") is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.

      The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools.

Blockchain is the foundational technology that powers electronic currencies such as Cryptocurrencies. In simple terms, a Blockchain is an electronic ledger that can be shared among different users. This helps in creating a record of transactions that cannot be altered. Each of these records is time-stamped and linked to the previous one. 
So every time a new transaction is added to the ledger, it is stored as another block in the chain of transactions – hence the name. Blockchain is updated after the different parties contributing to the ledger agree. After new data is fed into a block, it cannot be erased. This makes technology verifiable and secure.
This validation of transactions helps companies reduce their costs as no third party has to be paid. The system is very secure and there is no need for paying for centralized entities, as the technology is decentralized. Transactions are easier to track using Blockchain.

Edge computing is the latest technology trend that is getting famous by the day. The technology is based on the philosophy of bringing computing power as close to the data source. This helps in reducing bandwidth and latency.
The technology aims to run fewer processes in the cloud and shifting those processes to locations such as the user’s system or an edge server. Bridging this gap between the data and the computation reduces the long-distance communication between the server and the client, which in turn enhances the speed of the process. This is why edge computing is used for handling time-sensitive data stored in remote locations that have limited connectivity to the central location. The technology will make cloud computing and IoT devices faster. 
It is estimated that by 2022, the edge computing market will be worth $7 billion. The technology will be popular in areas such as healthcare, retail, and manufacturing. Thus, it will open the doors to many job opportunities. It is expected that the salary range of an Edge computing professional will be around $100,400 to $123,000 per annum
